AiCore - Linear Algebra Course 

This Repository contains all the materials needed for the Linear Algebra for Data Science course I'm teaching as part of the AiCore Syllabus.

The full course plan can be found in the root of this repository. The aim of this course is to help those students at AiCore who may not necessarily
have the mathematical background for the Machine Learning components of the AiCore course.
